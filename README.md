# CSV Plot: powerful plotting tool for CSV files

## What is it?
**CSV Plot** is a tool to simply plot any CSV file, of any size, without never getting out of memory errors.
(Only data which is displayed on the screen is loaded into memory.)

It works with user friendly YAML configuration files, to let you choose the layout, colors, units, legends...

**CSV Plot** is built on top of the amazing [PyQtGraph](https://www.pyqtgraph.org/) library, which ensures a nice and smooth experience, as plotting should always be.

## Installation
```
$ pip install csv-plot
```

## Basic usage
```
$ csv-plot <path to CSV file> -c <path to configuration file>
```
